# Security Policy

## Maintenance Status

This repository is part of a curated Computer Engineering project collection and is maintained in a finalized and stable state. The project is preserved as a complete and authoritative record, with its scope and contents intentionally fixed to ensure long-term academic and professional reference.

## Supported Versions

As a finalized project, only the version listed below is authoritative:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.0   | Yes       |

## Vulnerability Reporting Protocol

In accordance with established academic and professional standards for security disclosure, security-related observations associated with this project are documented through formal scholarly channels.

To document a security concern, communication is facilitated with the project curators:
  - **Curator**: [Amey Thakur](https://github.com/Amey-Thakur)
  - **Method**: Reports are submitted via the repository’s [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/8086-ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE-PROGRAMS/issues) interface to formally record security-related findings.

Submissions include:
  1. A precise and technically accurate description of the identified issue.
  2. Demonstrable steps or technical evidence sufficient to contextualize the finding.
  3. An explanation of the issue’s relevance within the defined scope of the project.

## Implementation Context: 8086 Assembly Language
This project is implemented using Intel 8086 Assembly Language, following MASM/TASM syntax conventions for simulation within the Emu8086 environment.

- **Execution Environment**: Execution occurs within 16-bit real-mode emulation environments (Emu8086, DOSBox).
- **Scope Limitation**: This policy applies exclusively to the source code and academic materials contained within this repository and does not extend to the emulator software, assembler tools, or underlying hardware security mechanisms.

## Technical Integrity Statement

This repository is preserved as a fixed academic and engineering project. Security-related submissions are recorded for documentation and contextual reference and do not imply active monitoring, response obligations, or subsequent modification of the repository.
