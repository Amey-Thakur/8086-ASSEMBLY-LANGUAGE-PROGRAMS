<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

## Overview

The **8086 Assembly Language Programs** repository is a curated collection of low-level assembly code designed to verify and strengthen the understanding of the 8086 microprocessor architecture. It demonstrates the practical implementation of instruction sets, memory management, and hardware simulation using the **Emu8086** emulator.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a comprehensive archive of hands-on coding experiments. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As a computer engineer, understanding the underlying hardware-software interface is crucial for low-level system design and performance optimization. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to tested assembly programs beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental 8086 concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through 8086 assembly programming.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these "Gold Standard" resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All programs in this repository were developed, verified, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) to master the 8086 architecture.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage Guidelines

### Execution Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/8086-ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE-PROGRAMS.git
    ```

2.  **Open in Emulator**:
    - Launch **Emu8086**.
    - Click `Open` and navigate to the desired `.asm` file (e.g., `Arithmetic/addition_16bit_simple.asm`).

3.  **Assemble and Run**:
    - Click the `emulate` button to compile.
    - Use the `Run` or `Single Step` controls to execute the code and observe register changes.

### Academic Use
This repository is openly shared to support learning and knowledge exchange across the academic community.

**For Students**  
Use these programs as reference materials for understanding assembly logic, instruction syntax, and modular programming. Code is heavily commented to facilitate self-paced learning.

**For Educators**  
The programs may serve as practical lab examples or supplementary teaching resources for Microprocessor courses (`CSC501`/`CSL501`). Attribution is appreciated when utilizing content.
