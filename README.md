<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

The **8086 Assembly Language Programs** repository represents a comprehensive collection of assembly code compiled during my academic journey to master the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

**Purpose:**
This repository was created primarily for **self-learning** and serves as a detailed documentation of my understanding of low-level system architecture, instruction sets, and memory management. It acts as an intellectual reference point, preserving the knowledge gained through practical experimentation and coding.

**Key Goals:**
- **Knowledge Preservation**: To document and organize concepts for future reference.
- **Authentic Learning**: To demonstrate a clear understanding of 8086 assembly through rigorous coding and "Gold Standard" documentation.
- **Skill Development**: To master the nuances of direct hardware manipulation using the Emu8086 environment.

Each program in this archive serves as a testament to the learning process, evolving from basic arithmetic to complex hardware simulations.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

### Prerequisites
- **Emu8086** (Recommended) or **DOSBox** with MASM/TASM installed.
- A text editor (VS Code with Assembly extensions recommended).

### Execution Steps
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/8086-ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE-PROGRAMS.git
    ```

2.  **Open in Emulator**:
    - Launch **Emu8086**.
    - Click `Open` and navigate to the desired `.asm` file (e.g., `Arithmetic/addition_16bit_simple.asm`).

3.  **Assemble and Run**:
    - Click the `emulate` button to compile.
    - Use the `Run` or `Single Step` controls to execute the code and observe register changes.
